# Svalbard Network

Since 2019, two netorks have been installed in the area of Ny-Ålesund. A first one on Kongsvegen, and a second one on Midtre-Løvenbreen. Both network have different data exit system. 1) Kongsvegen data are sent via a 4G relay located on the Telenor tower at Vegvaktaren. 2) Midtre-Løvenbreen data are sent to a gateway connected to internet in Ny-Ålesund at the Sverdrup station.
